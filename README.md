# MovePrediction
Predicting Chess Outcomes - Testing Ground for Potential Santorini AI Feature

The purpose of this project is to practice using different machine learning models to predict the outcome (win or loss) of a given prediction. The intention is to use such a model  in my Santorini AI project. Being able to predict an outcome from a game state would allow the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to exploit success moves in less time. 

Since there is no extant dataset for Santorini, I downloaded a chess dataset.

Currently, the Santorini AI uses a Gradient Boosting Classifier for its move predictions, alongside a non-ML heuristic.
